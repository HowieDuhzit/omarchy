 * The IframeWrapper class creates an iframe that can be used to load a document and then be disposed of. This is useful
 * for running a full NetworkedDOM document in an iframe and then disposing of it when it is no longer needed which will
 * clear up the <script> tags that were added to the document and their side-effects.
 *
 * The other use case this is intended for is as a target for a client connected to a document to synchronise the
 * document state to and have the custom element implementations for the elements in the document run in the iframe (and
 * therefore not pollute/conflict with the root window)
